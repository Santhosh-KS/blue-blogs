How did I automate my hostinger things.. Some more automation.
<br>
```python
def foo():
    print("Hello World!")
```


And not only Python...

```ruby
def foo()
    puts("...even Ruby, and many more.")
end
```

```bash
printf("Hello world")
```

Thanks to Rouge.

### Quotation block

According to someone...

> This is an example quote made with Blue.

### Add some formulas

Blue comes with MathJax included, allowing you to use LaTeX Math notation on Markdown.

$$f(x) = x^2 - x^\frac{1}{\pi}$$

And another one.

$$f(X,n) = X_n + X_{n-1}$$
